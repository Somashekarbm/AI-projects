This mini project basically tries to guess a famous potrait/picture from a given user prompt 
-- the dall-e-3 model is more advance then dall-e-2 as it reshapes the prompt to get a better picture output 
-- whereas the dall-e-2 is the default model for image gen , its performace is good and it can give accurate picture predictions if the prompt is well designed to meet the pitcure specifications.
